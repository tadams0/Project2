A good project 2 has 3 layers:

1. Frontend 	(With different roles)
2. Middle Tier 	(Must manipulate data)
3. Backend	(Good schema)

A project 2 should have:
2+ or more user roles (2 is a bare minimum)
A database schema with more than 4 tables.
Must have a theme
Interactive front-end.
	*Could have reports, but this is optional.

	Proposal
		-> Name of product
		-> 3-5 sentences describing the application
		-> List of roles and their permissions/powers/abilities (What they can do)
		-> 10+ User stories (Try for 15 or 16)


2 Sprints
	-> 1 for each week.
	-> Work done in user stories. Each sprint will have multiple user stories.

Trello Board
	Product Backlog		Sprint Backlog		In-Progress		Testing		Peer-Review		

If someone is assigned a user story in one of these categories, then they cannot have a user story elsewhere.

Each user story corresponds to a feature. User stories can be assigned points. Usually rated on the 
fibonacci, TShirt, or num scale.
		Fibonacci
		1,2,3,5,8
		TShrt
		xS S M L xL
		Num (Can't use Num)
		1 2 3 4 5

At the end, compile a burn down chart.
